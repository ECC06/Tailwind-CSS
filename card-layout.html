                    <p class="my-4">
                        A small, tree-dwelling mammal native to the Himalayas
                        with reddish-brown fur and a bushy ringed tail. Despite
                        its name, it's not closely related to giant pandas but
                        is more similar to raccoons. Red pandas are excellent
                        climbers and feed mainly on bamboo.

                        A charismatic marine mammal found along the coasts of
                        the Pacific Ocean. Sea otters are known for using rocks
                        as tools to crack open shellfish while floating on their
                        backs. They have the densest fur of any animal, with up
                        to a million hairs per square inch.

                    <p class="my-4">
                        The grizzly bear is a large subspecies of brown bear
                        native to North America, primarily found in Alaska,
                        western Canada, and parts of the northwestern United
                        States. These powerful predators can weigh between
                        400-800 pounds (with males being significantly larger
                        than females) and stand up to 8 feet tall when on their
                        hind legs.

                    <p class="my-4">
                        The world's smallest fox species, native to the Sahara
                        Desert. Fennec foxes have enormous ears (up to 6 inches
                        long) that help them dissipate heat and locate prey
                        underground. Their cream-colored fur helps them blend
                        into their sandy environment.
